## 🤖 AI Support Explanation (IBM Granite)

This project used **IBM Granite**, an **AI-assisted development model**, during the **development phase only** — not in the final product.

IBM Granite was used to:

- **Generate code structure** and suggest modular separation (`game.js`, `keyboard.js`, `words.js`)
- **Improve documentation clarity** (README and inline comments)
- **Suggest better gameplay logic and UI improvements**
- **Perform error checking and debugging recommendations**

⚠️ **Note:**  
IBM Granite **is not part of the deployed web app**. It only assisted developers during the **code creation and documentation stages**.
