## 📖 Description

**Wordle Indonesia** is a 5-letter word guessing web game that uses **Bahasa Indonesia vocabulary**.  
Players must guess the correct 5-letter word within limited attempts — similar to the classic **Wordle**, but localized for Indonesian learners.

This project was developed for educational purposes, focusing on learning **JavaScript modular programming**, **DOM manipulation**, and **AI-assisted development workflows** using **IBM Granite**.  
It has been deployed using **Vercel** for ease of access and demonstration.
